# Encrypted logs
To be able to handle encrypted logs you need to add/replace the dummy key with your private key in the file
  ```bash
   flight_review/app/private_key/private_key.pem
   ```

Once you have the private key there, you should be able to upload encrypted logs and display them using the corresponding private key.
